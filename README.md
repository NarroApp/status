# Staticus
A static status page, designed to be blazingly fast and quick enough to update.

- Runs on GitHub pages (jekyll)
- Supports multiple status channels (e.g. _Apps_ and _Data_)
- Supports 'scheduled maintenance' posts
- Supports uptime history (of configurable length)

## Usage

To update the system status page (homepage), just create a new post in `_posts/`.

Staticus uses a couple custom frontmatter fields:
- `action` denotes the type of status message. (_incident-error_ or _incident-warning_ or _resolved_)

Staticus also looks at the `tags` frontmatter to determine the appropriate channel for the update. You can update multiple channels with the same post. Define your channels in `_data/tags.yml`.

- Any tag with `system: true` will be treated as a top-level system channel.
- Any tag with `scheduled: true` will be treated as a scheduled channel.
    - These are shown at the top of the status page.

To run on GitHub Pages:
- Fork the repository
- Update the `_posts` and `_data` respectively
- Update the CSS styling (_optional_)
- Update the `CNAME` file
- Push it up!
